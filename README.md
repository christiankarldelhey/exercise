# Christian Karl Delhey Capitole techcnical exercise:

Please search for the solution of the exercise in the app.vue file.
After some tests, I took a recursive approach to support also future categories changes in the array.
I created a simple UI to test the solution with Nuxt and tailwind.

Thank you for your time! :)
