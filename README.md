# Capitole technical exercise:

Please search for the solution of the exercise in the `useCategories.ts` composable file.
After some tests, I took a recursive approach to support also future categories changes in the array.
I created a simple UI to test the solution with Nuxt and tailwind in the `app.vue` while the logic remains in the composable. Also I made tests with vitest to check the assumptions.
Everything is typed with Typescript.

Thank you for your time! :)
